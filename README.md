## KNN Algorithm

Reco utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to recommend mood-based songs. The KNN algorithm is a simple and intuitive machine learning algorithm that classifies new data points based on the similarity of their features to existing labeled data points. In Reco, the algorithm considers various musical features, such as tempo, mood, genre, and instrumentation, to determine the nearest neighbors and recommend relevant songs.
